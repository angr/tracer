# WARNING
This package is deprecated. All the work has been merged to angr as Tracer and
CrashMonitor exploration techniques. Although we do provide a layer for
backward compatibility here, direct use of these new exploration techniques in angr
is preferred, since it offers more flexibility.

# Installation
If you have QEMU compilation problems, installing these packages may be useful (tested on Ubuntu 14.04 64bit):

    apt-get build-dep qemu-system
    apt-get install libacl1-dev
